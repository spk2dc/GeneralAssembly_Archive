# Morning Exercise

## Where are we going?
During Unit 1, here on out, most of the morning exercises will be dedicated to HTML and CSS. You will get to do mockups (like today).  Code alongs (lead by an instructor), or have group activities to work through.

In hw, you'll be given short videos to review topics you'll have covered in Fundamentals, as a quick refresher and get you ready for the morning exercise. We are going to keep building on what you have learned from Fundamentals or to introduce you to a new topic so that you can make the most out of your morning exercise time.

As Unit 1 progresses, we'll start putting together all the pieces, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and your assignments will bring all of these things together.

Topic's we'll be covering (Unit 1) during Morning Exercise (not set in stone):
- Mockups
- UX/UI / Intro to Web Design
- Wireframing
- User Stories
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design
- CSS Animations
- Modals




## HTML Refresher

You'll be making an HTML page. Today, you'll work on the html. During the next morning exercise you'll work on the css portion. If you need a quick  refresher before you jump into coding, look back at the [HTML video on elements and media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhbnrDhWDdE&index=2&list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J)

1) Inside your `morning_exercise` folder, create a file for the blog site site. What should you name the file?
    - go ahead and make the file
2) How do you add the boilerplate needed for an HTML file?
3) How do you add a title to my file so that you can see the name on the browser tab?


# Activity

## Directions
Look at the image below and create this webpage using HTML (no styling yet - we will do the CSS for this page during the next morning exercise).

**IMPORTANT** Make sure to check your work in the browser *as you write your code*.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
Using the command `open index.html` inside the terminal when you are inside the folder with your `index.html` file will open your application in your browser.

## Commit Your Work

1. Get used to committing your work! After you create a tag, push the work.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
  - `git add .` to add the file
  - `git commit -m "add a message"` to make a commit
  - `git push origin master` to push it the work to your branch of the class github repo

## Plan before you code!
- Take a few minutes to describe what you see and figure out what tags you'll likely need

## The Mockup

## The Resources
1. URL for image: https://imgur.com/NzdTHeo.png
    - NOTE: This image is large! You'll have to resize it using CSS later on
 
1. Don't worry about matching the colors/fonts exactly, but in case you do want to try: 
     - The fonts were found on [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
     - Consider using a color picker to find the hex codes used in the mockup!
        - Macbooks come with an app called Digital Color Meter that you can use, or you can find a color picker online through google

1. For text to fill the paragraphs, there are a few ways to do this:
     - in your `.html` file type `lorem` and press tab to get some auto generated text by atom.
     - use [a standard Lorem Ipsum generator](http://www.lipsum.com/)
     - want more flavor? Choose one from [this list](http://meettheipsums.com/)
     - explore even more and practice your google-fu

1. The links that you create do not have to go anywhere, but you should be able to click on them.
    - Reminder!: Use a `#` to make a "dummy" link.
    
## Finished Outlining the HTML Early? 

1. Do another mockup! We've provided a second mockup in the [doggie directory](doggie).
    - [View the mockup here](doggie/readme.md)
    - `cd` into the `doggie` directory and do your html layout mockup in the provided `index.html` file!
       - If you get to the css, make sure to use the provided `main.css` file as well
    - :elephant: Reminder: We provided all the images needed in the `img` folder, so you'll need to use _relative pathing_ to get those into your index.html

1. Or, just move on to the hungry for more below

## Hungry for More?

1. Create an `about.html` file which has similar content to the index.  

2. Have the "About" link in the `index.html` file send you to `about.html`.

3. Have the "Home" link send you to the `index.html` page.

4. Add a `style.css` file, link it, and start styling the site to match the mockup as close as you can!
