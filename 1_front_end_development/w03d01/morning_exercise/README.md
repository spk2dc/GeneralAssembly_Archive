During the last morning exercise, we built out the HTML for the VSSL mockup:

![vssl](vssl_mockup/mockup.png)

This morning, we're going to work on styling it with CSS to make it look more like the mockup.

## Setup

1. You already created the HTML for this mockup last morning exercise. You should have it in your `w02d03/morning_exercise/vssl_mockup` folder. We called it `index.html`.
1. Let's copy your work into your student_examples folder for today.
1. In terminal:
    - navigate to your `/w02d04/morning_exercise/vssl_mockup` folder
    - from there type `cp ../../../w02d03/morning_exercise/vssl_mockup/*.html .`
        - The cp command will copy all html files from last morning exercise's folder into today's morning_exercise/vssl_mockup folder
        - _NOTE:_ if you have created your files elsewhere, you will need to adjust the path
        - _NOTE:_ if you created more files than this (like a CSS file), you will also need to copy those files
1. Inside your vssl_mockup folder, create a `style.css` file. Make sure it's on the same level as your `index.html` file as well as the `img` folder and `mockup.png` file.
1. Inside your `index.html` file, link your `style.css`
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - You can check that your CSS is attached correctly by adding a background color to the page temporarily.  

## Activity

1. Your focus should be on positioning the content!
1. Save looking for fonts for last. You don't need the exact font - just choose something that looks similar.

## Resources

If you struggled making the html, we've included an sample_index.html for you to work off of in the vssl_mockup folder.
