# Portfolio Site

## Contents of your portfolio site:

Make sure your portfolio site...

- Is hosted on Github Pages (as this will be a static site).
- Contains a list of your current projects (with links to the live sites).
- Contains your resume.
- Contains your bio.
- Contains a link to your github profile.
- Contains a link to your LinkedIn account.
- Is functional for all screen sizes (responsive).

Additional possibilities:

- Optional / nice touch: Add a list of links to various sites in the tech world that you follow.
- Optional: Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to help with styling on your portfolio site.
- Optional: Link a purchased URL (possibly your name (.com)) to your site. You can start [here](https://medium.com/@hossainkhan/using-custom-domain-for-github-pages-86b303d3918a) for research on connecting the URL to your site.
