# Project Advice:

## Plan Plan Plan

Make sure you write out what you’re going to accomplish each day from from project start until presentation day (What you plan to have complete by the end of today, tomorrow, etc.)

  - That way, you’ll know when (not if) you start falling behind.  This is really important.  Don’t just start coding.  Have a plan.
  - Plan to get everything finished and deployed at the least two days before presentation day.  That way, when something doesn’t go according to plan, you’ll have a few extra days of padding
  - Spend serveral hours, if not a whole day, planning and pseudo coding

## Start as simply as possible

Start with the simplest possible product and add features

  - Don’t try to get every single idea you come up with, just create something that barely meets the requirements.  Then, depending on how much time you have left over, you can add more features.
  - Leave styling until your last full day of coding

Commit early, commit often!

## Getting Help

Reach out to instructors when (not if) things start falling behind and we’ll help you get the project back on track

Reach out and talk to each other for help

  - Send a message to the group if it's not during TA hours
  - Ask them to help you fix bugs
  - Don't ask them how to do your project

## Avoid Plagiarism!

Research syntax online

  - Careful, though!  Don't look for a tutorial that shows you how to do your project (or even a small chunk of it).  That's plagiarism!  If you're unsure about what's okay to use, ask us

How to avoid plagiarism

  - Keep a "code graveyard" of all the code you wrote that you didn't end up using.
    - comment out those lines and either keep them in place or move them to the bottom of the file or a different file altogether
  - Cite your sources
    - Anything that you found online should have an attribution, even if you altered it
      - Simply put a comment with a link to site where you took it from

## Enjoy the process!

Relax and try to have fun!

  - Unless this is your final project, the likelihood that you'll be heavily judged by it is pretty small.  Instead, use it as a chance to learn.  This is a chance to solidify what you know
  - It's like driving a route for a while with GPS and then one day you don't use GPS.  It's a little scary at first, but you'll be suprised what you remember, and from then on, you'll never forget it!
