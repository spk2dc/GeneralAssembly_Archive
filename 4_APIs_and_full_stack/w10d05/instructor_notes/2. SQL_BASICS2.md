## Lesson Objectives

1. Alter a table
1. Limit
1. Sorting
1. Aggregation
1. Joins

## Alter a table

```sql
ALTER TABLE users RENAME name TO first_name; -- rename a column
ALTER TABLE users RENAME TO people; -- rename a table
```

## Limit

```sql
SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 1; -- select all columns from people table, but show only the first row
SELECT * FROM people LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1; -- select all columns from people table, but show only one row.  Skip the first row
```

## Sorting

```sql
SELECT * FROM people ORDER BY first_name ASC; -- show all rows from people table, order by name alphabetically
SELECT * FROM people ORDER BY first_name DESC; -- show all rows from people table, order by name reverse alphabetically
SELECT * FROM people ORDER BY age ASC; -- show all rows from people table, order by age ascending
SELECT * FROM people ORDER BY age DESC; -- show all rows from people table, order by age descending
```

## Aggregation

```sql
SELECT SUM(age), first_name FROM people GROUP BY first_name; -- divide all rows into groups by name.  Show the SUM of the ages of each group.  Also show what name each group has
SELECT AVG(age), first_name FROM people GROUP BY first_name; -- divide all rows into groups by name.  Show the AVG of the ages of each group.  Also show what name each group has
SELECT MIN(age), first_name FROM people GROUP BY first_name; -- divide all rows into groups by name.  Show the MAX of the ages of each group.  Also show what name each group has
SELECT MAX(age), first_name FROM people GROUP BY first_name; -- divide all rows into groups by name.  Show the MIN of the ages of each group.  Also show what name each group has
SELECT COUNT(age), first_name FROM people GROUP BY first_name; -- divide all rows into groups by name.  Show how many rows have a value in the age column.  Also show what name each group has
SELECT COUNT(*), first_name FROM people GROUP BY first_name; -- divide all rows into groups by name.  Show the number of rows in each group.  Also show what name each group has
SELECT group_concat(first_name), age FROM people GROUP BY age; -- divide all rows into groups by age.  List the names in each group and show what age each group has
```

## JOINS

If we make a new table `companies`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies ( id integer primary key autoincrement not null, name varchar(20) );
ALTER TABLE people ADD COLUMN employer_id integer; -- warning: this action is not easily reversible!
```

We can query people and join them with their employers, by ID:

```sql
SELECT * FROM people CROSS JOIN companies;
SELECT * FROM people JOIN companies ON people.employer_id = companies.id; -- find all people who have an employer_id column set and show which company they work for
SELECT * FROM people LEFT JOIN companies ON people.employer_id = companies.id; -- find all people have an employer_id column set and show which company they work for.  In addition to this set, include all people who do not have an employer_id column set
```
