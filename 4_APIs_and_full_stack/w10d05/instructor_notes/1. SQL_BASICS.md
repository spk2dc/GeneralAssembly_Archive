# SQL

## Objectives
1. Contrast relational and non-relational databases
1. Instantiate a new DB
1. Connect to Sqlite through CLI
1. Create a table
1. Insert into the table
1. Select from table
1. Update the table
1. Delete from table

It's time to learn our second database format! SQL is an older form of database
management. Despite it's age, it's still one of the most common and popular
forms of data storage in building web applications

### MongoDB is non-relational (noSQL)

MongoDB is document based. Meaning, data is organized in collections of related
documents formatted in JSON.

#### Key Advantages

##### Usability

- Documents (i.e. JSON objects) correspond to native data types in many
  programming languages (like mongo + JSON)
- Documents can contain data that varies or is incomplete.

##### High Performance

- Documents can be embedded in one another reducing the need for joins.
- Simple queries are very fast

### SQLite is relational (SQL)

SQLite is a relational database management system that comes pre-installed on MacOS. There are many others
like MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. They are all queried using SQL.

#### Key Advantages

##### Consistency

- a lot of data is tabular already, relational databases store it in a similar
  form
- Schemas mean you know exactly what attributes (columns) for each database
  entry (row)
- Schemas can check the type of data being stored to ensure data coming in is
  properly formatted and consistent with other entries.
- writes to a database follow ACID paradigm (atomicity, consistency, isolation,
  durability) which guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures etc. More about [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)

##### SQL Dialect

- SQL is used in most relational databases meaning interaction across different
  relational DBMS is very similar
- SQL is well documented and extremely robust in its utility
- SQL queries are a powerful tool to quickly retrieve data in a large variety of
  ways.

### Lets Talk Terminology

# SQL - Up and Running



## Connect to SQLite through CLI

If you're using the sqlite3 app that comes with MacOS, you can create a new database and open it from the terminal:

```bash
$ sqlite3 example.db
```

## Data types

SQL has the following data types:

1. integer - whole number
1. decimal - float/decimal
1. bool - boolean
1. varchar(n) - small text
1. text - large text
1. timestamp - date

## Create a table

- Instead of collections, we have tables, which are just like a spreadsheet, or grid.  Rows are entries, and columns are properties of each row.
- Unlike MongoDB, you have to tell SQL what data type each column is. It's very "strict."

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo ( name varchar(20) ); -- create a table called 'foo' with one column called 'name' which is a small text column
.tables -- describe your tables
DROP TABLE foo; -- drop a table
CREATE TABLE users ( id integer primary key autoincrement not null, name varchar(20), age integer, email varchar(32) ); -- 'users' table has an id column, which is just a number, a name column, an age column, and an email column
PRAGMA table_info(users); -- describe the columns of the users table
```
### By default, Sqlite will display info like this:

```sql
1|Matt|36|matt.huntington@generalassemb.ly
```

### which isn't the most readable. To make this prettier, you can run the Sqlite-specific commands:

```sql
.headers on
.mode columns
```
[Additional SQLite specific commands](https://sqlite.org/cli.html)

## Insert into the table

```sql
INSERT INTO users ( name, age, email ) VALUES ( 'James', 36, 'james@generalassemb.ly'); -- create a row
```
## Run a seed file

```sql
.read users.sql
```

## Select from table

```sql
SELECT name FROM users; -- select all rows from the users table.  display only the name column
SELECT * FROM users; -- select all rows from the users table.  display only the all columns
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Matt'; -- select all rows from the user table where the name column is set to 'Matt'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%Matt%'; -- select all rows from the user table where the name column contains 'Matt'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Matt' AND email = 'matt@generalassemb.ly'; -- select all rows from the user table where the name column is set to 'Matt' AND the email column is set to matt.huntington@generalassemb.ly
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Matt' OR email = 'matthew@generalassemb.ly'; -- select all rows from the user table where either the name column is set to 'Matt' OR the email column is set to matt.huntington@generalassemb.ly
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 36; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column is set to 36
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age != 47; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column is not set to 16
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 26; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column is greater than 26
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age < 46; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column is less than 46
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age <= 36; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column is less than or equal to 36
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= 36; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column is greater than or equal to 36
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age IS NULL; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column has no value
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age IS NOT NULL; -- select all rows from the user table where the age column has any value
```

## Update the table

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'Matthew' WHERE id = 2; -- update the users table.  Set the name column to 'Matthew' for every row that has the id column set to 1
```

## Delete from table

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1; -- delete all rows from the users table that have the id column set to 1
```
